# JumpCloud StatTracker

```
StatTracker module has built in methods to store actions and calculate their average times.
The getStats method will return an Array of "actions" and their "average times".
```

```sh
git clone git@github.com:lmaon2466/jumpcloud.git # or clone your own fork
cd jumpcloud
npm install
```

## Testing the Modules

```
